# Winds-Of-Berkana

Winds of Berkana is a GameDev Técnico Project. GameDev Técnico is a Portuguese youth association in which our members are university students (bachelor, masters, and doctoral) with an interest in game development and adjacent areas. 

Our core goal is to create an environment that enables non-professional game developers to improve their skills in game development, accelerate their ideas with other enthusiasts, and to participate in projects with established institutions and companies to improve their portfolio.

We want to create a game that explores a beautiful fantasy world, a world of mountain ranges and ruins, flying whales and floating islands.
